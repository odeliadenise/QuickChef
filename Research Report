QuickChef Research Report

User Research
To understand users’ cooking needs, preferred cuisines, dietary preferences, and any specific food challenges, we first conducted a research with a few targeted questions in mind. 
The questions are as listed below : 
“What cuisine(s) do users cook most often?”
“Do users follow any dietary restrictions? (e.g., gluten-free, vegan)”
“What frustrates users about using recipe apps?”
“How long do users typically spend preparing a meal?”
With these questions, we then start gathering data of what users would typically want and need and implement them into our website. After the whole research we acknowledge what we can do differ from other recipe apps or websites, all while maintaining uniqueness and as well as accessibility.
